; The boundary definition of all systems are 
; only those entities which form part of 
; chains of feedback back into the system.
; i.e. The system ends at the point where 
; it no longer has the ability to cause effects 
; in itâ€™s own nodes. i.e. Two given nodes are
; part of the same system if there is a route
; between their inputs and outputs. Or something.


; a system is made up of parts which, themselves, are systems

; a system has an environment which is made up of other systems 
; which interact with the system in the system's past, present 
; or future



; systems can be looked at as:

;   lists of parts
;   relationships between parts
;   function of the system relative to it's environment
;   function of the parts of the system relative to the system
;   function of the system relative to itself i.e. 'replicate' ???
;   see... function can be thought of as 'negotiated service' which is
;          how most folk see it which is why 


; systems can also be described and played with using one's imagination
; exploring this aspect of systems is mostly what phlo is about!

; what does it mean to be connected?
; what does it mean to be separate?


; 10 000 layers of abstraction is poisonous
; why has it worked out this way ?
; is it because either:
;   . the meta system is not powerful enough
;   . the meta system is a brain-dead ripoff
;   . the meta system is not understood by programmers?
;   . there is a false duality between the programming language, os and runtime libraries?
;   . we believe that somehow machine language programming is an evil to be shut in a 5 foot steel safe
;   . being able to use other people's code requires abstraction
; do we avoid the problem with the phlo approach ?
